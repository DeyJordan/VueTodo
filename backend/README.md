# Getting Started

This is the back-end of the app, it has been made with NodeJs.

- Open a terminal, an use "cd" to get to this folder (backend).
- Use the command "npm install" to install all the modules needed to make it works.
- Use the command "node index.js" to make the server run.

You are ready, now you can read the frontend README :)
