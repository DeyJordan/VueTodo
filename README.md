This basic to-do list manager app is part of a nodeJS (backend) and vueJS (frontend) project for the university.
It allows people add, delete, modify and see a to-do list.

## Getting Started

You just need to clone the project copy up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Anyway you will find a README in each folder to describe how to get started either front and back side of this app.

Our recommendation is to begin doing the backend.

## Features

- You can add a to-do to the to-do list.
- You can delete a to-do from the to-do list.
- You can modify a to-do from the to-do list.
- You can see all the to-do list, using a pagination.

## Some difficulties found

We think the number of hours to learn both, nodeJs and VueJs, are not exactly what we need to do something as we have been asked to do.

We found difficulties finding and installing third-part middlewares to arrive to do what was asked.
Also, we had some difficulties trying to make it work both parts together.

Anyway, we did it and it works ! :) we are so proud of us haha !
